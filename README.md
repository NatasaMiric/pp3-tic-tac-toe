# How to play

Tic Tac Toe is based on the classic pen and papper game and requeres a good logical thinking. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). 

In this version, the player is represented with the 'X' sign and computer with 'O'.

Players take turns by entering a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to the square in the 3*3 grid.   

After each round, user is able to see his and computers choice on the board. 

The winner is the first player who gets his three marks ('X' or 'O') on vertical, horizontal or diagonal row.
